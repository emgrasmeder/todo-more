<h>todo-more is yet another task manager.</h>
I'm making it just for myself, because I like command line tools and I have this problem where I make too many to do lists, scattered throughout the different task folders I use.
<br>
todo has basic functionality right now. I'm trying to make a new commit every day, with functional code additions each time. It'd be cool if all the tasks I've tagged with "todo-more" in my own personal to do list also magically appeared in this readme file. I'll add <b>that</b> to the list. 
<br>
See, it took a ctrl+shift+t, run the file, add the 4 fields as prompted, and it's in the list! 
<br>
Anyway, I'm gona keep trying to add a new feature or improvement as often as possible, but the code is very much experimental, so use it at your own risk.
