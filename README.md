I want an executable file that I can very simply add a new line to a file I already have existing. It should do the "sort" functions automatically for me, so that I can either VIEW or ADD to it, and it will show me the stuff I want.

Example:
ADD: then provide (as prompted) date, priority, project, etc
VIEW: optional inputs: ("I only care about my NLP tasks", for example)
Automatically sort by Done? If not done, Priority (OR TASK).
