<h>todo-more is yet another task manager.</h>
I'm making it mostly for myself as a central place for me to add new and possibly fleeting ideas as they come to me.
<br><br>
The code has only basic functionality right now, and is a work under constant construction.
<br><br>
It's my goal to continue adding functionality without breaking anything that already works, but the code is very much in the experimental phase, so use it at your own risk.
